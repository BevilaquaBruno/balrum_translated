    <dia pl="3" str="I have to bring back the remains of the necromancers to Darkwood. If I fail, everyone dies. They were planning this for years now. I have no choice. I have to go."/>
    <dia npc="3" str="Leonard knew that something was not right about these woods. He kept saying that he feels a dark presence. We didn't listen to him. I'm so sorry that you got into this. It's our fault and now you and the others are in great danger. We need to keep calm. You cannot tell anyone about this. They don't know who we are. They think we are simple villagers just like them. Talk to Arlo, he will know what has to be done. No matter what blood you have, you will always be my grandson."/>
