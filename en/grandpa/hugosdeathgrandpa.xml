    <dia npc="1" str="Yes, son, your memory serves you well. That poor Hugo did die at night. He was the only friend of Cardew. The two of them were close and Cardew was in a much healthier state when Hugo was alive."/>

    <dia npc="3" str="Well, Hugo was a popular fellow but the only real friends he had were Cardew and the innkeeper, Fred."/>
