He was a lousy helper and quite a drunkard for his age, but if you see him could you tell him that I'm waiting for him and his help is needed here. Until then, can you bring me some raw wood and some bark?"/>

Now old Ivo has to satisfy the rebels' thirst on his own. I will need a lot! Forty logs will do. If you do this for me I'll tell Ivo that you were good help. He might let you in the circle. You will know what I mean."/>
