    <dia npc="0" str="They are none of your concern."/>
    <dia pl="1" str="Let them free or I will..."/>
    <dia npc="1" str="Not too hasty. The only reason you are still alive, is that we want you alive. All of your so-called friends are a waste of precious life, but you are different. Your blood is different."/>
    <dia pl="2" str="My blood is different? What are you talking about?"/>
    <dia npc="2" str="Stupid boy. Because you have royal blood of course."/>
    <dia pl="3" str="I don't have royal blood in me. I'm from a simple farmer family."/>
    <dia npc="3" str="Interesting. They haven't told you about your origins. Do you even know who you are living with? Ha, you probably have no idea why your people came to our woods. Now why would they do that? Why would they lie to you for so long? To protect themselves of course. They are so cowardly they won't even trust you with their secret! In all honesty they had to, because if the poor peasants somehow learned who they are living with, the rebels would be here in no time. They created a perfect lie."/>
    <dia pl="4" str="You are trying to confuse me. It's not going to work! Now tell me; where are the Packs?!"/>
    <dia npc="4" str="Stubbornness, good, good. I'm probably one of the few who's not lying to you. Isn't it a bit strange that no one else has decided to live here in Darkwood? Only a few people when there are thousands living out there. It's because most of you are from the castle. Some of your neighbors were nobles from the castle. Your pathetic friends decided to run away from their inevitable faith. The rebels weren't after the peasants. No, they were after the King and his followers. You few managed to slip away and sneak into our woods, but on the way your people stumbled upon a small village. Luckily, most of you were already in disguise wearing simple peasant clothes, not your royal garments. It was easy to convince them to join you. How wonderful! Now you had servants, and protection too! I must say that when I heard that, I was really impressed. Your real grandfather was King Triston, and your father was King Edward."/>
    <dia pl="5" str="You have no proof of these lies!"/>
    <dia npc="5" str="Use your head, child. Look at your so called Grandfather. Magic runs through his veins. Would a simple peasant be able to use magic? Look at all the others. Are alchemists, blacksmiths or librarians simple villagers? There are even knights in shining armor amongst them and a mage from the mages' guild. Even an old drunk high priest. When the peasants separated into two villages, half of you stayed in your village while the others decided to live with Kyler to be able to observe everything closely."/>
    <dia pl="6" str="If you are telling me the truth then tell me one thing. How do you know these things?"/>
    <dia npc="6" str="Our dear, dear friend Arlo was most helpful for a long time. He kept us in touch with everything that was happening on the surface. Until the poor fool realized we had already lured a few of your young down here. We should have waited. After one of our meetings he sealed the portal with all of us down here. Thanks to you, now we are free once again."/>
    <dia pl="7" str="This cannot be true... Who are you?"/>
    <dia npc="7" str="You know who we are. We are the true owners of these woods. Our kind has been living here for centuries. Most of us were slaughtered by Triston, but our time has come once again."/>
    <dia pl="8" str="Why are you burning down my village and kidnapping people?"/>
    <dia npc="8" str="We have the right to do so. We made a deal with you."/>
    <dia pl="9" str="What deal?"/>
    <dia npc="9" str="When you cowardly entered our woods we made a deal with your leader. The deal was that your people may live in the woods but after twenty years we are free to collect untainted souls for whatever reason we have."/>
    <dia pl="10" str="Untainted souls?"/>
    <dia npc="10" str="Children of course. Children without the bond held by their ancestors. They are only useful to us if their parents are out of the way."/>
    <dia pl="11" str="You monsters!"/>
    <dia npc="11" str="Now, now, you don't want your luck to turn. Believe me, it was not easy to convince my brothers to spare you. After all, you are the blood of Triston. But you are much more useful to us alive than dead."/>
    <dia pl="12" str="This has to stop! What do you want? We will leave Darkwood if we have to."/>
    <dia npc="12" str="Leave? That would be a dumb thing to do. Think boy! Now let's talk about why you are here. Much as it angers us, we have to admit that we need you. We don't need the Packs and the others. We can only complete our ritual if we regain our powers. You see, Triston thought that he had killed us, the old fool. He could only harm our bodies. He scattered our remains throughout Balrum. We need you to bring back our remains to us."/>
    <dia pl="13" str="Why would I do this for you?"/>
    <dia npc="13" str="You have to. Needless to say if you refuse, you and your people will die. We will tell the rebels about Darkwood. All these years we were waiting for you, boy. We were waiting for you to grow up. You see, Triston was not that bright, but his advisors were. They tried to destroy our remains but they failed miserably. This is why Triston scattered them. They made sure that only the royal bloodline would be able to get to them. They used all their knowledge of the arcane to seal our resting places. Only you are able to get entry to them. And now that you have proven that you are capable we know that you will succeed. The fires and the kidnappings were all for you. And you have done well."/>
    <dia pl="14" str="What happens if I help you? What will happen when you regain your powers? You will continue your dark rituals and kill innocents. I won't be a part of that!"/>
    <dia npc="14" str="You have no choice! You opened the portal and we made sure that those runes won't be a problem again. The portal remains open. It cannot be sealed with the runes any more. All these years we were slowly regaining our powers. We are still weak without our bodies but we were able to bring fire to your homes and summon a few of you even when the portal seal was intact. Imagine what we can do now that you have opened the portal. You have set us free."/>
	<dia pl="15" str="I didn't know. I was only trying to help the Packs."/>
    <dia npc="15" str="You don't have to worry about the Packs any more. Ha ha! Just like your ancestors you are reckless too. We understand that this task is not a simple one. You have a year to bring back our remains to us; during this time we won't harm anyone. It's up to you to find each and every hiding place. Once you have all four of them you may enter the city again. Remember you have one year, little 'prince' Ha ha ha!"/>
