It's in a horrid condition, I might add. There are large spots of rust on the greaves and the left vambrace."/>

But if you could do my work while I'm repairing it we might have a deal! I'm running out of iron ore. Bring me 10 lumps of iron and I'll repair this fine armour. I'll start the work right now."/>
