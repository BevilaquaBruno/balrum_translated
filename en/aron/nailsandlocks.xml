If you're lucky you might find iron, or even more rare materials while cracking those large rocks. If so, you can sell them to me, or make tools or even weapons out of them. I'll gladly teach you the art of blacksmithing. It would be good for you, and for me too. Nowadays I only make farm equipment and other boring things."/>
