    <dia npc="2" str="It has to be in working condition. Ohh, and the older the guitar the better, but there should be no big cracks on it, small ones are fine. The wood matures you know. Old wood can have incredible overtones. Maybe you will find a rare one made out of perfect pinewood. I await your return!"/>
