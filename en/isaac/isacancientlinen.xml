Of course, he helps but I can see it in his eyes that this is not for him. Anyway, what were you interested in?"/>

    <dia npc="1" str="I see you are interested in magical robes. I have to tell you right away that you shouldn't get too excited. The guild of mages demanded so many magical robes that I have completely run out of those old linen pieces. Truly powerful magical robes can only be made out of ancient linen pieces."/>
    <dia pl="2" str="What if I bring you some?"/>
    <dia npc="2" str="Ahh... an adventurer. I like your kind. If you bring me some ancient linen pieces I can teach you how to make clothing out of it. Sure, I won't do it for free. Let's say if you bring me five pieces of ancient linen I will teach you how to handle them."/>
