If you can prove that you are to be trusted and you are honourable, you will be accepted into our society. I have a task for you. One of our members has been missing for a while. He was exploring the old coal mine north east of here just above the stone quarry. Give me your map I will mark the location. Why he was given this task is confidential. Learn what happened to him and report back."/>
