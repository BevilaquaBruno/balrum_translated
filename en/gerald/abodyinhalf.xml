Even the children. I remember the face of a beautiful young woman. She was right where you are standing. She was staring at me. I was covered in blood. The woman looked me right in the eye and said 'You will never kill us all'. Then she sliced me in half. The pain! I feel the pain! For how many years.. I still feel the pain. She put a spell on me so I could not move. And she forced me to drink a potion. I understand now. I deserve it. We were just like them. Taking innocent lives."/>
