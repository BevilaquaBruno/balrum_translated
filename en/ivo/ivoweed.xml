The secret is to age the spirit in these special casks you see around here. And the bigger secret is that the one I give the rebels is only aged for a few weeks. The bloody idiots are not sophisticated enough to taste the difference. I have to add some color to the product because to get this wonderful dark red color one has to age the spirit for years. One day I will try to give them one without added color. They might be stupid enough not to notice."/>
