The ratio between the magical energy level determines where the user will be teleported. I had to ask around the guild to get an accurate picture of where the mages' library is located. Thankfully, a few of our members have already broken into their tower a few times. I advise you to use it at night, when most of the mages are asleep. Good luck with your mission, shadow."/>
