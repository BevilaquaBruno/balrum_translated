Adjusting a rune to teleport you exactly where you want to go is a tiresome and lengthy procedure. I will have to ask you to complete an equally difficult task for me."/>

Well, if you're out of luck you might have to dig them all up. Currently I'm the rune maker of this guild. Knox enchants the runes with magical energies, but I complete them. Many years ago there was a famous rune maker in our guild named Lester. His body was buried in that cemetery near the asylum. Legends say that he was buried with a few of his unfinished runes! I can't even imagine what kind of powerful runes they might be. Your task is to find his body and bring me back his unfinished runes."/>
