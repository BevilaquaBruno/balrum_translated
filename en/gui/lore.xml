    <lore n="These are the most fascinating creatures I have ever seen in my life, and I have seen many things, to say the least. I am the best at what I do, there is no question of that, but still I have no idea how these creatures manage to withstand even the most powerful spells. I cannot finish my book without solving this mystery!" />
    <lore n="These creatures somehow regenerate. They simply cannot be destroyed! We've tried everything. Nothing seems to work. They cannot be immortal. It must be this place. These golems can only be found in caves like this cave in Darkwood. But what makes this cave different?" />
    <lore n="The crystals! All this time the solution was right under our noses! The large cerulean cave crystals can heal these creatures! All it took was dumb luck. The golem we were trying to defeat was too powerful. We had to flee, but the golem chased us right back to the entrance. And it happened. Lance, who is a powerful battlemage, threw a fireball at the beast. The beast stumbled and kept marching at us. Lance conjured another fireball that blasted the golem into millions of small shards. We quickly realized that the only thing that had changed compared to our numerous previous efforts was that near the entrance there are no large cave crystals. At last I can finish my book!" />
    <lore n="My family is getting bigger and bigger. I have nearly a dozen children and, oh joy, how I love them! Ned, Kate, Owen, Theresa, William, Roy, Bobby, Thomas, Ella and Charlie. I am the most fortunate of mothers. No thanks to that wretched husband of mine. He was no man. He could not give me what I wanted. He could never remember what I asked him to do. Always fiddling with his potions. That doesn't matter now. I'm the happiest woman alive. If only Charlie had less of an appetite. He ate Paige and Alex. That no good boy! I had to punish him for what he did. He won't be allowed to come out of the well until he learns his lesson. I wonder what Barnabas and the others would say if they saw my beautiful children." />
    <lore n="I don't need them. Filthy fat blisters. Now that my walls are complete they can't bother me any longer. 'Dumb Patty', 'Stupid Patty', 'Crazy P' You cannot harm me here. If only mother was here and Ron. I miss you so much, Ron. What could have happened to you? The only thing I also miss from above are the ceremonies. Everyone from the woods gathered at the old church and sang songs. In church no one pestered me. And when the human skull was placed on the table the magic happened and they came." />
    <lore n="My best hiding place so far! The acolytes will never find this place. And if they do the frogs will scare them away. This necklace is priceless, my dear diary. It fools the frogs into thinking that I'm one of them. I took countless hours to replicate this necklace, so that I can give one to Patty. We could come down here together, so we could have a little peace. I'm going to leave the original here and try to go back wearing the one I made. %l%Ron," />
    <lore n="The workers are digging really fast. I knew these no good beggars will work their hearts out if I pay them well. The poor fools don't even know what they are looking for. If they knew they were going to find unimaginable treasures for me they might demand a share of the riches. The entrance must be somewhere here." />
    <lore n="Nothing. Still nothing. The workers demand more food. They say they can't keep working at this place if they don't get enough to eat. I won't be fooled. I'm paying them more than they ever earned. The entrance to the old city has to be near! " />
    <lore n="Today we found a large chamber, but it's only another part of the cave. I knew these stupid lowlifes will decide to dig in the wrong direction. One of them died. The others are furious. They say that it's my fault because I work them to death." />
    <lore n="Rest in peace our dear master. We will keep your teachings alive for eternity. Nasrus will once again walk amongst us." />
    <lore n="The Keeper knows that I'm here. I must be extremely careful. I hope this cape will hide me from his gaze. The legend says that no one has ever reached the top of this tower. I shall be the first!" />
    <lore n="A lot of my men died including myself. They should have listened to me. I told them that the end is near and we have to choose a side. The kings cannot stop this from happening. The only way is if we surrender. Now I'm the commander of the legions of the undead. Soon the necromancers will summon enough of the dead so there will be no power that can stop them. My initiation is complete. I drank the blood of innocents. There is no turning back. " />
    <lore n="They are coming by the hundreds. The warlocks are luring more and more people into the woods. Even the wild animals cannot withstand the power of their magic. We have to find a solution to the problem with the bones. The rituals are getting more powerful every day." />
    <lore n="We kept track of every body for as long as we could. May the high priestess watch over their souls." />
    <lore n="Your first task is to go to the preparing facility. There your duty will either be to prepare sacrificial items or move the leftovers underground." />
    <lore n="Master, we were able to summon twice as many of the dead. It is working. We are now able to conjure more powerful rituals. I wonder if we can improve our rituals even more." />
    <lore n="May the souls of our brave soldiers and the souls of the ones who were bewitched by this evil place rest in peace under the gentle grace of Adacus." />
    <lore n="Show them the power of Nasrus, father. Let them see the truth. Those who don't belong here will flee in fear, but anyone whose eyes glimmers is one of us! " />
    <lore n="We cannot keep up with them! There are too many of them! We angered the forest and this is how it punishes us." />
    <lore n="We cannot decide who is innocent and who isn't. Our commander ordered us to slaughter everyone. Some of my fellow men are enjoying the slaughter. I don't think I can ever look myself in the mirror again." />
    <lore n="I often found myself thinking of the time we spent together when we were young. Do you remember the time when we found a giant beetle and you were so scared that you ran home? I'm looking forward to your next letter, Edith." />
    <lore n="My deer leg. %l% I like to eat. %n% Almost everyone likes to eat. %n% But not everyone likes deer leg. %n% I like deer leg." />
    <lore n="If you are reading this then you are in danger! Make this place your home. Here you will be safe. This forest is hidden from every power in the world. Only speak to whom you trust about this place!" />
    <lore n="I need something fancy for my wife. Maybe a golden ring with a large gem in it? Can you get such a ring? I'll pay you handsomely. %n%A." />
    <lore n="Edith only cares about him. She doesn't even notice me. I'm stronger than him and I'm even wealthier. I don't know what she sees in him." />
    <lore n="I hope the voodoo dolls will work. I've read about this ritual in an old book of my grandmother. He is so handsome and he is the strongest man in the village. " />
    <lore n="I need to improve my skills as a healer. I had to dig those bodies up to study them. I know that the people won't understand this. They are too religious. They won't understand that I'm doing this for them. To sharpen my skills. I hope that the invisible spell will last long enough. But what should I do about the smell?" />
    <lore n="Your Eminence, it has begun. The Mad God has started to destroy Balrum. Fire rained from the sky. I saw the village where I grew up disappear in the flames. Many of us have died. How can the Gods allow this to happen? No one can stop him now. Not even his brothers. " />
    <lore n="The people are terrified. It has been three days since the last fires. We fear that a new onslaught is nigh. The Architect has a plan. I agreed to meet him tonight. We have to consider every idea. Until then we are going to keep trying to put out the remaining flames. I hope that whatever he's going to tell me, it will help us. I will keep you informed, your Eminence." />
    <lore n="The Architect's plan might work! We have to act as soon as possible. I'm going to gather all the able-bodied men I can find. I know that some of them simply won't help us. That's why I need to open the church's treasury. We are going to build a city underground, where the Mad God cannot reach us! I fear what might happen to the people in a closed environment, but there is no other way. " />
    <lore n="We found a place for the underground city. People have started to work. The Architect is hiding something from me. He told me that I would have not helped him if I knew. He left me with these disturbing words 'we must not dig too deep'." />
    <lore n="My troop was following a group of young girls. They were inhumanly fast. They ran straight into an underground cave. I saw the fear in my brothers' eyes. They are well trained soldiers. All of them knew that we will be at a disadvantage down there with the witches. Our leader yelled the words, and we had to go in." />
    <lore n="A deep darkness welcomed us down in the cave. There were stairs at the end. The moment all of us were down, the stairs disappeared. We could not see anything, but we heard the faint echoes of the girls' laughter. Suddenly dim red lights appeared everywhere. Our captain ordered Tim to scout ahead. He walked into the darkness. We were inside a tomb. " />
    <lore n="We could hear Tim's shouts of agony. After a while the shouts stopped. The girls' laughter got louder. There was no going back. The tomb was sealed. We could only go towards the red lights. Once again we had to follow orders. We knew in our hearts that soon we would be free of orders." />
    <lore n="I'm the last. Everyone else has died. The obelisks killed them. I'm going to follow them soon. I cannot move. I can hear the laughter loud and clear. I think they are around me in the dark. I heard them dragging the bodies deeper into the tomb. The sounds... I think they are eating them. Let them come near. Until my last drop of blood!" />
    <lore n="The vegetation is enthralling here. The plants grow astoundingly fast. During my research I found that there are plants here which are only visible at night. The sheer amount of plants growing in these woods are incredible. The wisps here are healing the wounded trees. Fascinating! I have to stay here a few days more. Thilda will understand." />
    <lore n="Never forget Fred! The recipe is the following: %l%-Mug of Beer %n%-Ghost Mushroom %n%-Coffee Bean" />
    <lore n="Today I tried to brew a new tea. My idea was to use rosehip as the main ingredient next to the usual water and honey. I grabbed my empty bottle and filled it with the goodies. The result was delicious. Another tea on my list!" />
    <lore n="The next ritual is near. There should be a human skull on my table by now. I will have a little talk with that lazy acolyte who should have brought me one." />
    <lore n="Dear Thurza. I can't go on like this. The nightmares are still haunting me. I see horrible things being done to my parents. I feel like that somehow it's because of me that they are tortured. I don't know why this dream haunts me. We left my parents behind. We left them." />
    <lore n="No wonder I haven't been able to find the herbs. I was looking in the wrong place or to be more specific wrong time. A number of plants are only visible at night. I think I'm going to lose a lot of sleep in the coming days." />
    <lore n="A simple arrow and a fireroot makes a good fire arrow." />
    <lore n="To make a nice loaf of bread simply add water to the flour then bake the dough until it turns golden." />

    <lore n="To make more powerful traps improve simple traps with special materials like: %l%-Snake Tooth %n%-Amanita %n%-Spider Web %n%-Taming Elixir" />
    <lore n="A sturdy splint is an indispensable accessory to an adventurer. You never know when you might walk into an accident. All you need to make a splint is some wood and some linen." />
    <lore n="A beverage that even women like. %l%-Apple %n%-Bottle of Honey %n%-Water %n%-Empty Glass" />
    <lore n="I figured it out! The portal seemed to activate when I approached it. The trick was to not wear any armour! I have to gather all my courage and step through. Maybe tomorrow." />
    <lore n="I was able to move the glowing obelisks. When they got close together their colour mixed and produced a new colour. The ancients must have sealed the grave with these obelisks. I just have to find the right combination." />
    <lore n="Finally! My initiation is tomorrow! I wonder what will be my task? Ron had to get a cow's heart. Alysa had to find her way out of the labyrinth. I hope I don't get the labyrinth. The boys told me a few acolytes died up there." />
    <lore n="You are only allowed to let in those who are on the list. Anyone else who tries to sneak in you have to punish. And you cannot let the old ones down, no matter who they are. In the years to come they will lose their minds and start to attack us. We can only let down the young. 'There is a huge list of names beneath the first paragraph.'" />
    <lore n="The king decided to move the city underground. The work has already been started. He demanded every single coin from the church to help pay the lowlifes for their work. Will we have a church down there your Eminence? What will happen to us? Are we even on that list?" />
    <lore n="The Architect finally told us why we cannot dig deeper. There are creatures living beneath and around us. He says these creatures were created before the mortal humans. The old gods banished them underground. What will happen if we stumble upon them?" />
    <lore n="There won't be enough space. What will happen to those who won't be allowed in? I'm hearing whispers that almost half of our people won't be able to come down to the city. What we are doing is wrong. We have to find a way to let everyone in." />
    <lore n="It is sealed. The entrance is no longer passable. The only way to enter is through the teleport. We left hundreds behind. May the gods have mercy on their souls and may the gods forgive us for what we have done. I saw many unable to escape the flames. They're still burning. We did not help them." />
    <lore n="We dug too deep. The black crab monsters and mantis like creatures poured into the city. We barely were able to fight them back to where they came from. The passage is now sealed, thank the gods. These creatures are really agile. Some of them looked like they were communicating with each other." />
    <lore n="The creatures can talk. We imprisoned a few of them and the larger ones could talk. This will upset the church. We are not the only intelligent beings in the realm." />
    <lore n="You have to come, Patty. He is so strong and big. We won't have to work for Sabrina any more. We could live with him for the rest of our lives." />
    <lore n="I'm too scared to talk to Queenie. Every time I get close to talking to her I get cold feet. There is no other option. I have to be drunk. Yes, that will help!" />
    <lore n="We have been talking with the boys for years now about the situation. Somehow we will reclaim the city and kill all the rebels. The cowardly scum were only able to defeat us when we were weak. We will find our king and win back his throne!" />
    <lore n="Lately everyone wants our product. The misery of the realm sure is good for business! I have to stash a little bit of it for myself, otherwise they will sell it all." />
    <lore n="Very Important Persons: %l%-Xander %n%-Malvin %n%-Paton %n%-Lander %n%-Bishop %n%-Rigg" />
    <lore n="We were just about to try to recreate the lost method of creating dark iron. The rebels scared away our master. Now the knowledge is lost for certain. Maybe someone from the other realms might know something, but I doubt it." />
    <lore n="A long time ago there were huge men who called themselves the bear hunters. Legends say they could fight the bears with their bare hands and the axes they held would be too heavy for us, even with both hands. It's hard for me to believe that, but the boys love to talk about them." />
    <lore n="They managed to break out of their cells. They didn't do any harm; they were quite well behaved, but all of a sudden they started to laugh uncontrollably. A few moments afterwards a fire started. The east wing has been damaged in the fires. We lost two of our patients and one of the nurses. We have to make sure this won't happen again." />
    <lore n="I have isolated two of our patients in the emergency hall. These two are the worst of them all. I shall experiment with them. If I remove a part of their brains I think I can cure their madness." />
    <lore n="My new method needs fine tuning. Both of the patients died a few days after the procedure. I have to be more careful. The others are starting to get alarmed. I have to cut away smaller pieces and wait until they heal." />
    <lore n="I have to give credit to my assistant who helped me in tremendous ways. We were quite lucky because no one expected a woman to do experiments. This is how we could keep my expertise a secret for so long. While I distracted the other one she could continue." />
    <lore n="I cannot continue my experiments here. My colleges won't understand the importance of my work. I have to find another location, but how will I get patients?" />
    <lore n="I could not believe my eyes. The minute I pulled the fish out of the water I knew something was not right. The fish was small, but for its size it was too heavy. When I cut it up there was a glowing stone inside. I don't mess around with objects like that, so I buried it behind the house." />
    <lore n="After the old gods created the realms, they found they were bored. So then they decided to create creatures in their image. The gods made a terrible mistake. They made their creations immortal. Immortality came with a terrible burden. They could live for hundreds of years but their minds slowly gave up on them. In this way the undead were born." />
    <lore n="Legends say the old gods created another kind of creature. They saw their mistake with the immortal humans so they created a powerful mantis like mortal beast. Their kind have been long forgotten by the gods and by the humans." />
    <lore n="One of the old gods was still displeased, despite the creation of the immortal humans. He found joy in their suffering. He burnt their villages and summoned giant meteors. Immortality became an even worse burden for them. They could not die in the flames. They burned for weeks." />
    <lore n="Eogor and Adacus realized the mistake their parents had made. They choose the humans as their children and altered them. They made them mortal. This marks the beginning of our kind's history. The ancient immortal humans remain mindlessly walking the Forgotten Plains." />
    <lore n="They are the worshipers of the dead - black mages who seek immortality. They knew that Adacus and Eogor won't grant them immortality. Only Nasrus can give them what they need." />
    <lore n="Necromancers participate in dark rituals. They offer human sacrifices to the daughter of the mad god Nasrus. Legends say that those who are sacrificed are the lucky ones." />
    <lore n="For their dark rituals they chose Darkwood. The woods hid the horrible things they did." />
    <lore n="After the old gods banished the mad god to the void the immortal people of the realm decided to leave their underground hiding place. Once again they walked the surface of Balrum. They saw the horror and destruction from which they had fled underground and decided to rebuild their city somewhere else." />
    <lore n="Some say one of the old gods came down to the ashes of city. They say the touch of a god gave Darkwood divine power. After realizing who his father was, Nasrus became uncontrollable. She channelled her anger towards the humans. She gathered a large following. Those who worship her have been granted immortality. She learned how to control the undead hordes and lured them close to the humans." />
    <lore n="Eogor and Adacus feared that Nasrus might turn into a new mad god. They ordered King Triston to put an end to what was happening in Darkwood at all costs. While Triston and his army distracted Nasrus they planned to banish her to the void." />
    <lore n="How could they say I transformed people? Lies! Lies! Lies! A bunch of liars. I can still hear their laughter. I was only experimenting. There were bound to be mishaps. Let's see if they will laugh if I transform a simple rat into a giant beetle!" />
    <lore n="I can hear noises. I swear I heard children laughing. I need to be carefull. This place is crawling with slimy monsters." />
    <lore n="There are unexplored parts of Balrum where mortals have never been. Some say that it is a dark place. A place abandoned by light." />
    <lore n="She left me for good this time. I could not give her what she wanted. She was a brilliant alchemist, especially masterful in creating transformation potions, but madness overcame her mind. Here I am still searching for the recipe of life. I will probably never find it. I will never be healed." />
    <lore n="Food for the wolves. The royal wolves need more food. The large wolf which always follows the king around especially needs a lot of food. That thing always seems hungry. I'm not going to cook for animals. Who do they think I am, and why do they let animals into the castle? Why do these animals serve the king?" />
    <lore n="The largest of the wolves keeps an eye on the king. Like a tireless bodyguard. I wonder what happened to those wolves. The castle was full of them. They disappeared when the rebels took over." />
    <lore n="Tutor of the royal family. He was chosen to live in the castle. If a royal descendant seemed to have magical powers he was the one who had to teach the child the ways of the arcane. Leonard has been missing since the rebels took over the realm." />
    <lore n="When we had that dreadful drought the royal alchemist helped us. He created a potion that not only cured diseased plants but kept them hydrated for a long time. I didn't thank him because there was a walking skeleton around him all the time and I was scared. I thought he was some sort of dark mage. When his potion turned out to be working the rebels attacked the city. We haven't seen him since. I should have thanked him for his help." />
    <lore n="I never understood why Aron was the chief royal bodyguard. As soon as the rebels attacked he ran away. If I ever see that traitor again..." />
    <lore n="A long time ago there was a farmer living near this city. He was a religious type and often visited the church. Every night he prayed to the gods for the wellbeing of all of those who lived in the realm. People went to him for advice. When the rebels attacked the castle he was the first line of defence. Legends say that the gods themselves protected him during the fights. We don't know for certain if he died or not, but he was lost in battle. Never forget Kyler, children. The world needs more people like him." />
    <lore n="We lost many members during the fights. The city never knew that we were there. We helped the castle when the rebels attacked. The names of our dead will never be remembered in songs or tales. A young thief named Rhys was only fifteen but he ran to the castle as fast as he could to help the wealthy peasants of the city. He was the child of the current leader of the guild. We should never forget who we are; we will never forget the young thief who sacrificed his life that day." />
    <lore n="I wonder what happened to Father Hain. He disappeared during the rebel attack. He was the one who brought me up. His disciplinary methods were sometimes harsh but they were effective. I was a difficult child but his teachings showed me the right way." />
    <lore n="All of our members learn about our healing methods. There was a monk who tried something different. He experimented with the deceased. We had to banish him from the monastery because our leader thought he was mad, but we saw what his methods did. He could heal fatal wounds without the use of magic. Let this be a lesson to all of us. Sometimes we have to allow the unfamiliar to explain itself before we judge it." />
    <lore n="There once was a great adventurer. During his adventures he helped the weak and the poor. Once he stumbled upon a burned down cottage. Next to the burnt corpses of his parents was a small unharmed child. The great adventurer decided to take care of him. He tried to make the child his successor but the boy was weak and fragile. No matter how hard he tried the boy was simply not meant to be an adventurer. When the great adventurer died this little boy continued what his saviour had taught him. He could barely move in the heavy armour of the adventurer, but he never stopped trying to be him." />
    <lore n="They called him barrel boy. Kids bullied him so he had to figure out something to protect himself. His father had an old wine barrel so he decided to fashion an armour out of it. Legends say that even now he walks around in a large and heavy armour made out of old barrels." />
    <lore n="Your commander is a traitor! He is helping the Darkwood necromancers with their dark rituals. If any of you have information on him report immediately to the guild. Benedict is now an enemy of the realm." />
    <lore n="The old gods created the dragons to oversee the realms. They gave them immense power and free will. When the dragons realized they can disobey the gods some of them disappeared and some of them turned against the gods and their creations. The only dragon we know about lives far away on a desolate island. Legends say the royal crypts are protected by a white dragon." />
    <lore n="There are many small islands close to our realm. Some say people live on them. Some say they are completely desolate." />
    <lore n="There is an old blacksmith legend that dark iron can only be made beyond the forgotten plains of Balrum. The darkness infuses the iron and makes it even tougher. According to the legend no mortal can smelt the iron, only an immortal blacksmith." />
    <lore n="Miners reported that after the two moons shined upon their rocks some of the rocks turned into moonstone. Moonstone is light as a feather and is very valuable." />
    <lore n="Beware! Beings who wander into the blackness of the forgotten plains turn into the blackness themselves." />
    <lore n="Those mages who reach the highest level of our art will be taught our most powerful spell - the Chaos Fire. We can only teach this spell to trusted members of the guild." />
    <lore n="The guild master will teach how to perform the Shadow Blade attack to those who are prepared. Only members of the guild can be taught." />
    <lore n="When a warrior becomes the strongest in the guild he will be allowed to learn how to perform the fury of the Colossus Smash. Only members of the guild can be taught." />
    <lore n="The two mighty adventurers. (Although Dudley is not so mighty.) %n%Our treasures so far; which we collected when exploring the ruins. -%l%A strange ring.
