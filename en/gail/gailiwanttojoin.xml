    <dia npc="6" str="That's the spirit! I will mark the map for you. Here, take this key. It will open the main doors of the ruins. The old ruin is protected by powerful magic. You can only see it if you have the key on you. I wish you luck! Also, if you find some of the previous recruits, please identify them. Just for the record."/>
