    <dia npc="1" str="I'm a fool. I get caught by the village idiot. What a joke, right?"/>
    <dia pl="2" str="So you admit you stole it?"/>
    <dia npc="2" str="I admit, I admit. Fine. It's worthless anyway. Here, take it."/>
    <dia pl="3" str="Why did you steal it from him?"/>
    <dia npc="3" str="The poor knucklehead told me it has magical powers. I was bored and wanted to take a look at it. First I asked, but he didn't wanted to show it to me. I asked again, but he refused. So when he went out of his house I snuck in. I didn't think he would immediately turn back and see me, but he did."/>
    <dia pl="4" str="But why did you keep it?"/>
    <dia npc="4" str="Everyone knows. I guess your grandfather didn't tell you. Back in the day I was quite a famous thief. I like to steal stuff. It's in my veins. My mother and my father were thieves too. Proud thieves who stole from the fat rich bastards."/>
    <dia pl="5" str="You're a thief?"/>

    <dia pl="8" str="What do you want?"/>
    <dia npc="8" str="I'm making a new tool for myself and I need some perfect pine wood for it. Bring me four pieces of perfect pine wood and I might consider teaching you a thing or two. Perfect pine wood is rare so you might need to chop down quite a few pine trees."/>
    <dia pl="9" str="What tool?"/>
    <dia npc="9" str="None of your business. Will you help me or not?"/>
