    <dia npc="2" str="At the time I was an apprentice of a great hunter. He told me that a long time ago a young blacksmith figured out how to wound these creatures. Your weapon needs to have certain crystals forged into it. It's a really quite simple procedure. I have a feeling that you are after those stone golems which roam these woods. It would be irresponsible of me to not give you a weapon since I know once you get something in your head.. Here take this, but be really careful. It's a really old weapon, it isn't worth much."/>
