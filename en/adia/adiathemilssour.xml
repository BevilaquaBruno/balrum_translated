If you do this, I will give you half of the money. Norsa and Zane also received sour milk. This is outrageous. In these times every thaler counts; the rebels won't allow us to have a fortune. If someone gets a small fortune together the rebels will come and take most of it away. Bardan's farm is just up from here to the north."/>
