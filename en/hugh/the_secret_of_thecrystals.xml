   <dia npc="0" str="I guess you saw my crystal in the main hall. I'm trying to figure out what kind of healing powers these crystals have. You know these crystals can heal the crystal golems. I found an old document regarding the golems and the crystals. The document describes the golems and the crystals relation. I doubt you've ever seen one in your whole life. They are wondrous creatures. As you might have figured out, I'm a blacksmith. I think I can forge magical weapons with the use of these crystals."/>

   <dia npc="1" str="The main purpose of these crystals is healing. So I imagine the weapon would have some kind of healing power!"/>

   <dia npc="2" str="Right now, I don't have the necessary ingredients for a decent weapon. Could you bring me ten lumps of iron ore and five lumps of silver ore? Oh, and I will need two flawless deerskins, too!"/>
   <dia pl="3" str="No problem! Can I have the weapon after you are finished with it?"/>
   <dia npc="3" str="Why of course not! If you want a weapon than you should bring twice as much as I told you."/>
