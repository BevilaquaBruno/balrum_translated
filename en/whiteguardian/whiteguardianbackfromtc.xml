    <dia npc="5" str="The mages had an idea when Triston showed them the remains. They thought that if Triston unites the dragons their power might be enough, but Triston was unable to gather the dragons. I was the only one at Triston's disposal and my powers alone were not enough."/>

    <dia npc="6" str="There are three of us left. I know that I'm the only one left on this island. Both my brothers left Balrum centuries ago. Time made Triston fail. He and the mages were too anxious. They wanted to get rid of the remains as soon as possible."/>
    <dia pl="7" str="Could you contact your brothers? Have you any idea where they might be?"/>
    <dia npc="7" str="It doesn't work that way. I cannot reach my brothers. I would have helped Triston in finding them but I couldn't. And I cannot help you either."/>
