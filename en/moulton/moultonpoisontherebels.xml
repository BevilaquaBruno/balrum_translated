    <dia pl="2" str="I guess you will send me on a mission so I can earn your trust. Am I right?"/>
    <dia npc="2" str="Ha ha! You are right, boy! I was going to ask you for a favour, but I have a good feeling about you so it's not necessary. The only thing I have to know about you now is that you can make hard decisions. Like, who lives and who dies."/>
    <dia pl="3" str="What are you talking about?"/>
    <dia npc="3" str="These rebels are milking every single person in the realm. They are the worst. Many of us have already fled the kingdom. I have heard stories about what they did to women after they captured the castle. Not only that, but they killed most of the nobles. If you don't believe me, just go to the church and look around. They've moved into the houses that belonged to the nobles."/>

    <dia pl="9" str="How many of them will die?"/>
    <dia npc="9" str="They will soon realize that something's wrong. Not all of them will eat from the poisoned food. I know what we are doing is wrong, but I hope we kill many of them."/>
