If I could get enough of it I might be able to make a bow out of that substance. There are all kinds of things that have that strange silver material on them. Rocks, trees even bushes. What do you say?"/>
    <dia pl="3" str="Where can I find some and how many do you need?"/>
    <dia npc="3" str="That is the hard part. I haven't found any in all my years. And the more you can get the better, since I don't know the material. I don't know how much it would take to create a bow. I think you should bring me at least three pieces."/>
    <dia pl="4" str="Fine. If I find them, I will bring them to you."/>
    <dia npc="4" str="Great! I don't expect you to come back with them soon. It won't be an easy task gathering them all, but I think it will be worth your time."/>
