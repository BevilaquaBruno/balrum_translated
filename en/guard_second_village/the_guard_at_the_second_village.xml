    <dia npc="3" str="Well. The other day when I was off duty I went exploring the old village. I thought I might find something of value. Instead of finding something that I can sell for a good price I lost my family ring. I was almost in the middle of the ruins when giant spiders attacked me. There were many of them but I fought myself through a few of them and managed to escape. Only when it was too late did I realise that I'd lost my ring. It must still be there somewhere. That ring has been in my family for many generations. Passed down from father to son. It's not a valuable ring, but to me it is so important. My hand is strangely cold without it. No one will help me retrieve it. Maybe you could find it? If you bring me my ring back, I will let you in!"/>
