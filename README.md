## How to install

### Extract the downloaded translation files(pt folder). Copy all files into the appropriate files/dialogs/* folder. (The "en" folder should never be overwritten!)
### If you did everything correctly the folder you just copied files in should look similar to the files/dialogs/en folder.
### Launch the game and you should be able to select the new language at the Main Menu. (lower right corner)
